Motion Detection Security System (Arduino + Ultrasonic Sensor + Buzzer)

This project implements a simple motion-detection security system designed for safeguarding valuables such as jewellery. <br> The system uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect movement within a specific range. When motion is detected, a buzzer and LED are triggered to alert the user.

📌 Features

Detects motion using ultrasonic distance measurements

Triggers a buzzer alarm when someone comes near the jewellery

LED indicator for visual alert

Low-cost and easy to build using Arduino components

Suitable for small security applications
